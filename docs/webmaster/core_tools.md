The following is a short introduction to the core tools used to manage our
web presence.

## Webmaster Expectations

### Access Requests

New club members that want to be able to write and publish articles on our site
need an administrator to provide them with access. The webmaster will need to
field these requests.

If club members become inactive, the webmaster will also need to remove access.

### Site Maintenance

The upgrade processes describe in the site maintenance section of this site
should be followed quarterly. The club's Google account has a "Webmaster
maintenance" calendar; if you subscribe to this calendar you can be pushed
reminders about when you should log in to keep the site up-to-date.

    It's important to spend a few minutes every few months keeping the site
    up to date. There are a few main benefits here: (1) going through this
    process frequently makes it easier to remember, (2) more frequent, small
    updates have less risk than infrequent, large updates

### Domain Registration

The registration for website needs to be updated every few years. Because of
how infrequently this happens, there's a risk we forget to renew, which will
result in our site being taken offline.

As a result, there's a reminder on the Webmaster Maintenance calendar to renew
the domain 6 months before it expires.

## Tools

### Accounts and Access Management

Where ever possible, we use team accounts that allow each user to have their own
unique login account. This is useful in that we can maintain accurate access
logs to see who made changes and accessed club resources.

The webmaster also has a separate service account login for all resources. In
general, this account should not be used; it exists for "break glass" scenarios.

Access to these credentials is managed by 1Password so that access can be granted
securely and access is audited.

### Web Hosting

We use Digital Ocean (DO) for web hosting. DO has extremely comprehensive how-to
guides and documentation. If you encounter issues when administering our DO
account, chances are you will be able to find docs that help.

### Github

Github is (currently) used to host the theme for our blog, as well as
auto-publish this documentation site. The [BAS Github Organization][bas-github]
is used to store all repositories.
