# Getting Started

Before you are able to add content to our site, you must be added as a staff
member. Please contact the club webmaster with your email address and access
level you think you will need. The access level options are:

* **Contributor**: You can add new posts, which will be submitted to the
  webmaster for approval before publishing.
* **Author**: You can create and publish your own posts, but you cannot edit
  posts created by anyone else.
* **Editor**: You can create and publish your own posts, as well as edit
  existing posts from other users.

Once the webmaster sends an invitation to join the site, you will get an email
with instructions for how to accept membership. Note that being a staff member
on the site is different from having clicked the "Subscribe" button.

If you would like to be able to add events to the club's Google calendar (this
is the calendar that appears on the club's homepage), you will need a Google
account (*e.g.* have an `@gmail.com` email). You can also ask the webmaster to
grant you access to add and update calendar events.

Once you have access to the site, go to the
[site's admin homepage](https://{{ site.base_url }}/ghost).
