    Access is granted to Google Analytics separately from access to the main
    BAS website. If you need to access Google Analytics, ask the webmaster to
    grant access (following [these instructions](user_management/google_analytics.md)).

We use [Google Analytics][google-analytics] (GA) for tracking site statistics.
The GA home page contains a number of useful reports.
