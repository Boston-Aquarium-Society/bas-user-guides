"Aquarium articles" are blog-like posts. They are similar to articles that would
be published in a club newsletter.

All previously published aquarium articles can be found on the [articles page][articles-page].

## Adding a new aquarium article

* Start on the [new post page][new-post-page]
* Open the post settings (by clicking on the rectangular icon in the upper right-hand corner of the page)
* In the "Tags" section, make sure that `article` is selected.
* If the article author already has an account on the site, select their name from the dropdown in the "Authors" section.
    * If the author doesn't have an account, set the post author to "BAS Webmaster" (and deselect your own name).
* Using the text editor, give the post a title, then type the body of the article.
  *  You can read more about how to use the text editor to create a good-looking post [here][ghost-editor-faq].
* Optionally, click "Add feature image" to associate a photograph with the article.
    * Photos look nice on the article page, so consider adding one if possible.
* **Important**: After finishing, make sure to publish the article! (Click "Publish")

!!! question
    * Have you remembered to publish the article using the publish?
    * Have you remembered to tag the post with `article` in the settings tab?

    If so, go to the [articles page][articles-page], and confirm that the article appears!
