# Event Calendar

Before you are able to add or modify events to the club calendar, you must first
be added as a collaborator. Contact the webmaster with your email and they will
add you (*Note*: This requires that you have a Google account)

## Adding new events

Please read [this guide][google-calendar-guide] for instructions on how to add
and modify calendar events.

Once an event has been added to the calendar, it will immediately be reflected
on the BAS website.

## Important considerations

* When creating new events, make sure they are being added to the "Boston
  Aquarium Society" calendar, instead fo your personal calendar. This will be
  configurable from a drop-down menu when adding an event (make sure it says
  Boston Aquarium Society and not your name).
* If you are creating a calendar event for a club meeting, make sure to click
  the `Add Google Meet video conferencing` button. This will automatically
  create a link that remote participants can use to join.
