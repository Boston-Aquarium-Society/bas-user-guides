To begin, log into [Google Analytics][google-analytics] using the Webmaster gmail account.

There are currently two user groups that individuals could be added to to gain
access to our Google Analytics account:

* **Webmaster**: Individuals who have full access to administer and modify the GA account.
* **Viewer**: Individuals who have access to view analytics statistics and create dashboards, but not modify the account itself.

Use [these instructions][add-user-to-google-analytics-group] to add a new user
to the correct group. Users should be added at the "Account" level within Google Analytics.
