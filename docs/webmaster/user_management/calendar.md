   :fontawesome-solid-cog: -> `Settings`  button (upper right)
3. In the left sidebar, scroll down to `Settings for my calendars` ->
   `Boston Aquarium Society`
4. Scroll down to `Share with specific people` -> `+ Add People`
5. Enter the user's email and select `Make changes to events` as the permission
   level.
