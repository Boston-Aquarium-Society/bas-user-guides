At time of writing, Ghost requires a system with a minimum of 1GB RAM.
This is a bare minimum, and often results in the system becoming unresponsive
(or requiring a reboot before performing system maintenance to free memory).

To alleviate these performance issues--without increasing the memory usage of
the system itself (to keep costs of running the club low)--swap memory has been
enabled.

If the amount of swap space become insufficient or needs to be configured,
please follow [this guide][swapspace-guide].
